## Particles_1
In this application, particles will be generated at the point/points where you left click.
They will not stop generating.
Each particle exists for a few seconds and then slowly dies, changing its color as it does so.

## Particles_2
In this application, particles follow the mouse across the screen at a fixed speed. 
And you can see that each particle maintains its inertia. 
Also, each particle draws a vector of the direction of its movement.
Finally, you can pause the application by clicking the left mouse button.
